Download all the education data from participating Pacific countries
in the palm of your hand. The Pacific Open Education Data app pulls
all publicly available data from an integrated open source Education
Management Information System (EMIS) specifically tailored to Pacific
Island nations. It is a work that will continuously improve and
welcomes your feedback. Data is currently published in the form of
analytics dashboards containing tables, charts, filters, etc. The
dashboards are organized into modules which are listed below:

* Indicators: common education key indicators (e.g. NER, GER, NIR, GIR)
* Schools: data about schools such as enrolments by gender, geographical location, managing authority, education level
* Teachers: data about teachers (e.g. qualified teachers, certified teachers, teacher to pupil ratio)
* School Accreditation: comprehensive data about schools based on a stringent accreditation framework
* WASH: comprehensive data about water, sanitation and hygiene
* Budget: data about how the country spends on its education system (e.g. public expenditure per pupil)
* Exams: data about performance of students based on standard-based assessment framework
* Special Education: aggregate data about special education

Not all countries will have all the modules above.
