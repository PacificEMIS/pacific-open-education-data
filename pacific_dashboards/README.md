This README file explains how to build and run Flutter application for Android and IOS

### Setup

  - Follow the [official Flutter Get-Started guide from Google]
  - Follow the [official guide] on how to setup IDE to work with Flutter
  
### Build

  - After the project is open in any IDE, you will see a lot of errors
  - We are using code-generation, so you need to run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` in project root
  - Now all error should be gone, select target device and run the application
